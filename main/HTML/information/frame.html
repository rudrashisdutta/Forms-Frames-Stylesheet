    <h3 class="heading">What is frame?</h3>
    <p class="data">HTML frames are used to divide your browser window into multiple sections where each section can load a separate HTML document. A collection of frames in the browser window is known as a frameset. The window is divided into frames in a similar way
        the tables are organized: into rows and columns. To use frames on a page we use "frameset" tag instead of "body" tag. The "frameset" tag defines, how to divide the window into frames. The rows attribute of "frameset" tag defines horizontal frames
        and cols attribute defines vertical frames. Each frame is indicated by "frame" tag and it defines which HTML document shall open into the frame.
    </p>
    <li class="subheading">The “frame” Tag Attributes:</li>
    <div class="data">
        <ol>
            <li>src</li>This attribute is used to give the file name that should be loaded in the frame. Its value can be any URL. For example, src = "/html/top_frame.htm" will load an HTML file available in html directory.
            <li>name</li>This attribute allows you to give a name to a frame. It is used to indicate which frame a document should be loaded into. This is especially important when you want to create links in one frame that load pages into an another frame,
            in which case the second frame needs a name to identify itself as the target of the link.
            <li>frameborder</li>This attribute specifies whether or not the borders of that frame are shown; it overrides the value given in the frameborder attribute on the "frameset" tag if one is given, and this can take values either 1 (yes) or 0 (no).
            <li>marginwidth</li>This attribute allows you to specify the width of the space between the left and right of the frame's borders and the frame's content. The value is given in pixels. For example marginwidth = "10".
            <li>marginheight</li>This attribute allows you to specify the height of the space between the top and bottom of the frame's borders and its contents. The value is given in pixels. For example marginheight = "10".
            <li>noresize</li>By default, you can resize any frame by clicking and dragging on the borders of a frame. The noresize attribute prevents a user from being able to resize the frame. For example noresize = "noresize".
            <li>scrolling</li>This attribute controls the appearance of the scrollbars that appear on the frame. This takes values either "yes", "no" or "auto". For example scrolling = "no" means it should not have scroll bars.
            <li>longdesc</li>This attribute allows you to provide a link to another page containing a long description of the contents of the frame. For example longdesc = "framedescription.html"
        </ol>
